# mips_static_binarys
Some static compiled ELLF binary for **MIPS32** linux.

You can run some interesting stuff like PHP/Lua/Perl codes on mips32 routes, turn your routes into web server or download server. do whatever you wann.

Download binary from release page. 

Some binary has dependencies on other objects even if they are compiled statically. The binary like tmux requires terminfo database, vim requires terminfo and vimscripts. those binaries can not run directly. you should setup right runtime and environment for those binaries. **Each static Binary has its documents please read carefully first.**
